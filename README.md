# Sentinel2

This repository contains Jupyter notebooks and resources for analyzing Sentinel-2 satellite imagery for selected cities. It focuses on generating NDVI analyses and visualizations.

## Repository Structure

- `City_NDVI_Density.ipynb`: Notebook for calculating and visualizing NDVI density in selected cities.
- `plots/`: Directory containing generated plots and visualizations.
- `selected_cities/`: Contains data or configurations for the cities included in the analysis.

## Features

- NDVI calculation from Sentinel-2 imagery.
- Visualization of vegetation density across urban areas.
- Reproducible workflows in Jupyter notebooks.

## Requirements

- Python 3.9+
- Jupyter Notebook or Jupyter Lab
- Typical scientific Python stack (numpy, pandas, matplotlib, rasterio, geopandas, etc.)

## Usage

1. Open the notebooks in Jupyter Lab or Notebook.
2. Run the cells sequentially to process and visualize NDVI for selected cities.
3. Modify city data in `selected_cities/` to add or analyze new locations.
